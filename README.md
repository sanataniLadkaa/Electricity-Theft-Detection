# Electricity-Theft-Detection
In this project I used Z score method
for data cleaning to remove outliers then after I applied many
machine learning Classifier likes Random forest, Decision tree
and Bagging classifier etc apart from this I also applied deep
Learning models like CNN LSTM and CNN RF and abled to
score 96% accuracy.
